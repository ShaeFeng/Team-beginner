What makes a popular song? Analysis of Spotify Music
More and more people listen to songs on streaming platforms nowadays. What characters makes a song listened by more people and earn higher popularity? Spotify provides us with detailed numeric data of songs allowing us to analyze their relationships with the popularity.  

The dataset we used, which is from Kaggle, contains more than 160,000 songsâ€™ features collected from Spotify Web API. And the data of features, which includes acousticness, danceability, energy, duration, explicit, instrumentalness, valence, popularity, tempo, key, liveness, loudness, speechiness and release year, were applied through various data mining approaches in our study. The study used various regression models, classification models, clustering algorithm, and visualization to analysis and answer two questions:  

What factors contribute to the popularity of a song and in what proportion? 

Which data mining method best predicts the popularity of a song that is not in the list? 

Besides, we also produced word clouds and did time series mining to analysis whether changing trends of individual numerical features exists.
